# Data Recovery Guide for a Phone with a Broken Screen

## Introduction

A broken or unresponsive phone screen can be a major problem, as it prevents you from accessing your data. This guide provides several methods to help you recover your data without needing to unlock your phone through the screen.

## Disclaimer

These methods may not work for all devices, and success is not guaranteed. If your data is critical, consider consulting a professional data recovery service.

## Method 1: Using a USB OTG Adapter and a Mouse

If your phone's screen is black but the touch digitizer still works, you might be able to unlock it blindly. However, if the touch screen is completely unresponsive, you can use a USB OTG (On-The-Go) adapter and a standard USB mouse to control your device.

**Steps:**

1.  **Connect the USB OTG adapter to your phone.**
2.  **Connect a USB mouse to the adapter.**
3.  **A cursor should appear on your phone's screen.**
4.  **Use the mouse to unlock your phone and navigate to your files.**

## Method 2: Using a USB-C to HDMI Adapter

If your phone's screen is completely black, you can use a USB-C to HDMI adapter to mirror your screen to a TV or monitor.

**Steps:**

1.  **Connect the USB-C to HDMI adapter to your phone.**
2.  **Connect an HDMI cable from the adapter to your TV or monitor.**
3.  **Your phone's screen should now be mirrored on the external display.**
4.  **If the touch screen is unresponsive, combine this method with Method 1 by using a USB hub with HDMI and USB-A ports.**

## Method 3: Checking Cloud Backups

Before attempting more complex methods, remember to check for cloud backups. Most modern smartphones automatically back up your data to the cloud.

*   **Google Photos/Drive:** Check your Google account for backed-up photos, videos, and files.
*   **iCloud:** If you have an iPhone, check your iCloud account for backups.

## Method 4: Official Manufacturer Tools

Some manufacturers provide tools that can help you access your phone's data from a computer.

*   **Samsung's "Find My Mobile":** This service allows you to remotely unlock your phone, which can be useful if you need to access it from a computer.
*   **Other Manufacturer PC Suites:** Check your phone manufacturer's website for any PC suite software that might allow you to access your phone's data.

## Method 5: Professional Data Recovery Services

If the above methods fail and your data is irreplaceable, consider contacting a professional data recovery service. These services have specialized tools and techniques to recover data from damaged devices.

## Conclusion

Recovering data from a phone with a broken screen can be challenging, but there are several methods you can try before giving up. Start with the simplest options, like checking cloud backups, and then move on to the more technical solutions. Good luck!
